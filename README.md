# mid.nma.rank
An extension of package multinma to adjust for minimally important differences when ranking treatments in a network meta-analysis.

PLEASE NOTE: 

1. This package only works for standard (aggregate NMA analysis) and not for ML-NMR population-adjustment methods using IPD as of yet.
2. The function plot.nma_rank_probs within the code file 'mcid plot.R' should be used instead of its equivalent within the package multinma to produce plots of estimates of probability and cumulative probability jth
